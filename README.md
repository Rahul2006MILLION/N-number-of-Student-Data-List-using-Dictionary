# N-number-of-Student-Data-List-using-Dictionary
This Python script collects and stores details (name, age, course) of multiple students using dictionaries inside a list. It uses for loops, user input, and dictionary access to display student data clearly. A great beginner project to learn loops and dictionary handling.
